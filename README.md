## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Theo Valembrun**, an **ICT Support Technician** with a passion for **networking and cybersecurity**. Currently, I'm laying the groundwork for a transition into **NOC Engineering**, with my sights set firmly on a future in **Cybersecurity**.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently sharpening my networking skills for my **CCNA certification** and diving into the world of code with my first programming language, **Python**.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also pursuing an online **Computer Science Bachelor's degree at the University of the People**, expanding my foundational knowledge.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **open-source projects** and am open to **freelance opportunities**, particularly those involving network automation, scripting, or foundational web development (HTML/CSS).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: My journey into tech, networking fundamentals, or starting with Python!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theovalembrun/)! My personal website, [theovalembrun.tech](https://theovalembrun.tech), will also be live soon with my portfolio.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My "to-learn" list (mostly Udemy courses) is incredibly long, but I'm determined to tackle them one by one! This GitHub is where I'll track my progress and share what I'm building.
