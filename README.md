## Hi there 👋

I'm **Theo Valembrun**, an experienced **ICT Support/Infrastructure Specialist** with a strong operational background in **ISP services** and **physical security systems**. I am strategically transitioning into **NOC Engineering** and **Net/Sys/Cybersecurity Administration**.

* 🔭 I’m currently sharpening my skills for the **CCNA certification** and diving into **Python** for network automation (NetDevOps fundamentals). I am also actively preparing for **CompTIA Security+** to solidify my security knowledge.
* 🌱 I’m pursuing an online **Computer Science Bachelor's degree at the University of the People**, expanding my foundational knowledge in systems and engineering principles.
* 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on **open-source network automation projects** and am open to **freelance opportunities**, particularly those involving network scripting, infrastructure monitoring, or foundational web development.
* 💬 Ask me about: Multi-technology network troubleshooting (**xDSL, Fiber, Satellite, RAN**), migrating systems to IP security infrastructure, or combining networking and security studies!
* 📫 How to reach me: Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theovalembrun/)! My portfolio is live and showcases my work at [theovalembrun.live](https://theovalembrun.live).
* ⚡ Fun fact: My professional journey has moved from supporting consumer modems to managing critical video infrastructure, giving me a unique end-to-end perspective on network reliability and security. This GitHub is where I'll track my progress and share what I'm building.
